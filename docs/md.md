# Function Documentation for `Cube` Manipulation

This documentation provides detailed explanations for each function responsible for manipulating or obtaining properties related to a `Cube` object. Each function contributes essential operations necessary for applications like a Rubik's Cube solver or simulator.

## 1. Function `func1`: Cube Creation

### Description
This function is responsible for creating a new instance of the `Cube` class. It clones the properties of `edge` and `corner` from the current cube instance to ensure that modifications to the new cube do not affect the original cube.

### Body
```java
return new Cube(this.getEdge().clone(), this.getCorner().clone());
```

### Dependencies
- `getEdge()`: Must return the current edge state of the cube.
- `getCorner()`: Must return the current corner state of the cube.

### Business Logic
Cloning ensures that the new instance has the same configurations as the original but operates independently, allowing for separate modifications without unintended consequences on the original cube.

---

## 2. Function `func2`: Apply Moves to the Cube

### Description
This function takes a `Cube` object `c` and a string `s` representing moves to apply transformations to the cube's configuration. It processes move notations, updating both the edge and corner positions and orientations based on predefined transformation maps.

### Body
```java
Cube temp = c.clone();
String[] moves = s.split(" ");
// Processing move notation...
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
    char ch = s.charAt(i);
    // Update edge position and orientation...
    // Update corner position and orientation...
}
return temp;
```

### Dependencies
- `getEdge()`, `getCorner()`, `setEdge()`, and `setCorner()`: Must be defined in the `Cube` class.
- Transformation maps: `nextEdgeOrientation`, `nextEdgePos`, `nextCornerOrientation`, and `nextCornerPos` must be pre-defined for valid operations.

### Business Logic
The function modifies the cube’s state based on the given move sequence, essential for applications like simulations or solving algorithms. It transforms the cube's current configuration by sequentially applying rotations according to the specified move notations.

---

## 3. Function `func3`: Repeat Characters and Reverse String

### Description
This function takes a string `s`, repeats each character three times, and returns the reversed result as a string. It uses `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation.

### Body
```java
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
    result.append(String.valueOf(s.charAt(i)).repeat(3));
return new StringBuilder(result.toString()).reverse().toString();
```

### Dependencies
- `StringBuilder`: A standard Java class used for efficient string construction.

### Business Logic
This functionality could serve various UI or data formatting requirements where move sequences or notations may need to be displayed in a modified manner, enhancing readability or usability.

---

## 4. Function `func4`: Compress Move Notations

### Description
This function processes a series of move characters, compressing consecutive duplicates into a specific format (e.g., `R` becomes `R`, `RR` becomes `R2`), while ignoring sequences of three or more duplicates.

### Body
```java
class Temp { ... }
Stack<Temp> s = new Stack<>();
// Logic to manage moves...
while (!s.isEmpty()) {
    // Handle duplicates and formatting...
}
return result;
```

### Dependencies
- Utilizes `Stack` and `ArrayList` for managing data structures without external dependencies.

### Business Logic
This function optimizes move notation, making algorithms more efficient by minimizing loop iterations and reducing complexity through standardized notation formats. This can be particularly useful in cube solver applications to simplify input.

---

## 5. Function `func5`: String Representation of the Cube

### Description
This function provides a string representation of the `Cube` object, including its edge and corner states formatted in a structured string format.

### Body
```java
return "Cube{\n" + "edge=" + edge.toString() + ",\ncorner=" + corner.toString() + "\n}";
```

### Dependencies
- Requires both the `edge` and `corner` objects to have a valid `toString()` method defined.

### Business Logic
Providing a clear string representation of the `Cube` allows for easy debugging, logging, and visualization of the cube's state, facilitating better understanding and monitoring of the cubes' configurations during operations.

---

## 6. Function `func6`: Get Current Edge State

### Description
This function returns the current state of the `edge` variable, which typically refers to edges on a Rubik's cube or a similar structure.

### Body
```java
return edge;
```

### Dependencies
- The variable `edge` must be defined and initialized prior to the function's call.

### Business Logic
Allowing external access to the `edge` state provides flexibility for other components to query the current configuration and make informed decisions based on it.

---

## 7. Function `func7`: Set Current Edge State

### Description
This function sets the `edge` property of the current object, allowing updates to the cube’s edges.

### Body
```java
this.edge = edge;
```

### Dependencies
- The `edge` parameter must be provided when calling this function, typically representing the new edge state.

### Business Logic
This capability is crucial for modifying the cube's state based on user actions or algorithm simulations, making it integral to dynamic cube manipulation.

---

## 8. Function `func8`: Get Current Corner State

### Description
This function returns the current state of the `corner` variable, which refers to corners of a structure like a Rubik's cube.

### Body
```java
return corner;
```

### Dependencies
- The variable `corner` must be defined and initialized prior to the function's call.

### Business Logic
This function serves to provide insights into the current configuration of the cube's corners, allowing for controlled manipulations in solving algorithms and simulations.

---

## 9. Function `func9`: Set Current Corner State

### Description
This function sets the `corner` property of the current object, allowing updates to the cube’s corners.

### Body
```java
this.corner = corner;
```

### Dependencies
- The `corner` parameter must be provided when calling this function, typically indicating the new corner state.

### Business Logic
By controlling the corner state, this function plays a vital role in the overall management of the cube's configuration during operations, enhancing the accuracy of simulations and solving methods.

---

In conclusion, each function plays a distinct role in the manipulation and management of `Cube` objects. The documented flow follows the order of dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their functionality in various applications like cube simulators or solvers.
