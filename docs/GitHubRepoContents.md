# Documentation for GitHubRepoContents Functions 

The following documentation outlines the functions within the `GitHubRepoContents` class related to interacting with GitHub's API to retrieve file contents and their structures from repositories. The flow of execution is presented in the order of the function calls, along with explanations detailing how each function works and the underlying business logic.

---

## 1. `main(String[] args)` 
**Description**:  
The entry point of the program when executed. This function orchestrates the retrieval and display of file contents from a specified GitHub repository.

**Functionality**:
- This function is currently set up to retrieve the contents of a specific file within a designated GitHub repository. It uses the `getFileContents` method to fetch the file contents based on provided global constants (OWNER, REPO, BRANCH).
- Additionally, there is commented-out code intended for listing the file structure of the repository which can be uncommented as needed.
- The retrieved file contents are parsed using a hypothetical `SimpleJavaParser` method, presumably to analyze or process the Java code.

**Business Logic**:  
The `main` function serves as the control center of the operations, tying together components of file retrieval and parsing functionality. It’s meant for users wanting a quick way to examine a file within a GitHub repository and could be expanded for additional features such as listing all files.

## 2. `listFileStructure(String owner, String repo, String branch, String path)`
**Description**:  
This function retrieves and lists the structure of files and directories within a specific path of a GitHub repository.

**Functionality**:
- Constructs the API URL to query for contents of the specified path in the repository.
- Opens an HTTP connection and sets necessary request headers, including authorization via access token.
- Calls the `checkRateLimit` method to ensure the request does not exceed GitHub's API rate limits.
- If the request is successful (HTTP response code 200), it processes the JSON response. It iterates through the returned content, printing out the names and types of files and directories (invoking itself recursively for directories).

**Business Logic**:  
This function is crucial for obtaining and displaying the organizational structure of files in a repository. It's beneficial for users who need to understand the layout of the codebase, inspect file types, or navigate directories within the repository.

## 3. `getFileContents(String owner, String repo, String branch, String path)`
**Description**:  
Retrieves the contents of a specified file from a GitHub repository in a decoded format (if applicable).

**Functionality**:
- Constructs and processes a URL to access the file content via GitHub's API.
- Similar to `listFileStructure`, it opens an HTTP connection, sets request headers, and checks for rate limits.
- If the server responds with a success status (200), it reads the input stream to fetch the raw file content, decodes it from Base64, and returns the plain text.
- In case of a failure (non-200 response), it calls the `handleErrorResponse` method to manage errors gracefully.

**Business Logic**:  
This method is integral for developers needing specific file contents, facilitating access to source code directly from repositories. The ability to decode Base64 responses is particularly necessary for binary files or certain types of text files stored in this format.

## 4. `checkRateLimit(HttpURLConnection connection)` 
**Description**:  
Checks and handles GitHub's API rate limits to prevent excessive requests that could lead to temporary bans.

**Functionality**:
- Evaluates the x-rate-limit-remaining response header to determine if the user has exceeded their request quota.
- If the remaining requests are zero, the method pauses execution for a defined period (`RATE_LIMIT_DELAY`) to allow the rate limit to reset.

**Business Logic**:  
This function ensures compliance with GitHub's API usage policies, improving the reliability of requests by automatically managing the rate limits. It prevents wasted attempts and potential disruptions for users by allowing appropriate waiting time when limits are hit.

---

## 5. `handleErrorResponse(HttpURLConnection connection)` 
**Description**:  
Handles error responses stemming from API requests, such as when a specified resource could not be retrieved.

**Functionality**:
- Fetches and prints the HTTP response code returned by the server.
- Reads the error stream from the connection to provide detailed error information.
- Closes the connection after reading error data to clean up resources.

**Business Logic**:  
Error handling is vital for any API interaction. This function aids users by providing feedback on what went wrong when fetching data, ensuring developers can debug issues with clarity about the nature of the errors (such as 404 errors for non-existent files).

---

In summary, the functions within `GitHubRepoContents` collectively allow the retrieval of file contents and the directory structure from GitHub repositories, while robust error handling and adherence to rate limits improve the user experience and operational integrity. Each function seamlessly builds upon the last to deliver a comprehensive toolkit for GitHub interactions.
