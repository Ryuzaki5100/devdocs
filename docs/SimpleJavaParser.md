# Documentation for SimpleJavaParser Functions

This documentation outlines the functions of the `SimpleJavaParser` class, explaining their purpose, functionality, and the flow of execution. The functions are designed to parse Java code, convert it to a JSON representation, and demonstrate the parser's capability in a main method.

## Function Overview

1. **SimpleJavaParser.parseJavaCode(String javaCode)**
2. **SimpleJavaParser.parseCodeToJSON(String fileContent)**
3. **SimpleJavaParser.main(String[] args)**

### 1. SimpleJavaParser.parseJavaCode(String javaCode)

#### Purpose
This function is responsible for parsing a string of Java code into a structured format that can be further processed. The parsing is performed using an external library, `JavaParser`, which analyzes the Java code and produces a `CompilationUnit`.

#### Functionality
- **Input**: A string `javaCode` representing the Java code to be parsed.
- **Output**: Returns an object of type `JavaFileStructure` if the parsing is successful; otherwise, it returns `null`.

#### Execution Flow
1. An instance of `JavaParser` is created.
2. The `parse` method is called with the `javaCode` string, resulting in a `ParseResult<CompilationUnit>`.
3. The function checks if the parsing was successful and if a valid `CompilationUnit` result is present.
4. If successful, it creates an instance of `JavaFileVisitor`, which is a visitor designed to traverse the parsed compilation unit.
5. The `cu.accept(visitor, null)` method call applies the visitor to the compilation unit, allowing it to extract necessary structure.
6. Finally, the visitor's `getJavaFileStructure()` method is called to retrieve the resulting `JavaFileStructure`.
7. If parsing fails, an error message is printed to the standard error, and `null` is returned.

#### Business Logic
This function serves the foundational role of transforming unstructured Java code into a structured format that can be utilized by other components of the system. It is critical for any subsequent operations that need to inspect or manipulate the Java file structure.

### 2. SimpleJavaParser.parseCodeToJSON(String fileContent)

#### Purpose
This function converts the parsed Java code structure into a JSON string. This transformation allows for easy serialization and is useful for APIs and other forms of data transmission.

#### Functionality
- **Input**: A string `fileContent` representing the Java code to be parsed into JSON.
- **Output**: Returns a JSON string representation of the `JavaFileStructure` or an error message in JSON format in case of failures.

#### Execution Flow
1. An `ObjectMapper` instance from the Jackson library is created and configured to enable pretty-printing of JSON outputs.
2. The `parseJavaCode` function is called with `fileContent` to get the `JavaFileStructure`.
3. If parsing fails (i.e., `parsedStructure` is `null`), it constructs a JSON object with an error message and returns it.
4. If parsing succeeds, it serializes the `parsedStructure` into JSON using `writeValueAsString()` and returns the resulting JSON string.
5. A try-catch block captures and handles any exceptions that may occur during parsing or serialization, providing appropriate error messages as JSON.

#### Business Logic
This function serves as a bridge between the parsing logic and the representation needed for data interchange formats. It enhances the flexibility of the system by converting internal structures into widely used formats, facilitating interaction with web services and other applications.

### 3. SimpleJavaParser.main(String[] args)

#### Purpose
The main function serves as the entry point for the application. It demonstrates the parsing process of a predefined string of Java code and outputs the JSON representation of the parsed structure.

#### Functionality
- **Input**: An array of strings `args` typically used for command-line arguments (not utilized in this implementation).
- **Output**: Prints the JSON representation of the parsed Java code to the console.

#### Execution Flow
1. A multi-line string `javaCode` is defined, containing a sample Java class implementation.
2. The `parseCodeToJSON` function is called with the `javaCode` string to convert the Java code into a JSON representation.
3. The resulting JSON string is printed to the console.

#### Business Logic
This function acts as a demonstration of how the parser works with a specific input, showcasing the capabilities of the `SimpleJavaParser` class. It allows users and developers to understand how to utilize the parsing functions within an executable context.

---

### Summary
The `SimpleJavaParser` class's functions are intricately linked, with `parseJavaCode` as the core parsing method, followed by `parseCodeToJSON` for serialization, and culminating in the `main` function that showcases the functionality. This modular design ensures separation of concerns, making each function responsible for a specific aspect of the workflow, ultimately promoting maintainability and reusability in software development.
