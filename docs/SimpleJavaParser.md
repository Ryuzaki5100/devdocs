# Documentation for SimpleJavaParser and its Functions

This document outlines the functions of the `SimpleJavaParser` class, detailing the flow of execution, interdependencies, and the underlying business logic behind each function. The primary goal of this class is to parse Java code, convert its parsed structure into a JSON format, and provide a main entry point that executes the parser with a sample Java code.

## Function 1: `parseJavaCode(String javaCode)`

### Overview
The method `parseJavaCode` is responsible for parsing the provided Java code string into a structured format, specifically a `CompilationUnit`. It utilizes the JavaParser library to perform the parsing.

### Parameters
- `javaCode`: A `String` containing the Java code to be parsed.

### Returns
- An instance of `JavaFileStructure`, which represents the structured information of the parsed Java code.
- Returns `null` if parsing fails.

### Execution Flow
1. **Parsing the Code**: The method uses `JavaParser` to parse the provided `javaCode`. The result of this parsing is encapsulated in a `ParseResult<CompilationUnit>`.
2. **Success Check**: It checks if the parsing was successful and if a result is present. If successful:
   - A `JavaFileVisitor` instance is created.
   - The parsed `CompilationUnit` (`cu`) is visited by the `JavaFileVisitor`, which traverses the structure and constructs a `JavaFileStructure`.
3. **Return the Structure**: The constructed `JavaFileStructure` is returned.
4. **Error Handling**: If parsing fails, the method logs the encountered problems and returns `null`.

### Business Logic
This method is essential for converting raw Java syntax into a structured, programmatically navigable format. The successful traversal through the code structure allows further manipulation or analysis of the Java code, such as converting it to JSON representation.

## Function 2: `parseCodeToJSON(String fileContent)`

### Overview
The method `parseCodeToJSON` transforms the Java code content from a `String` format into a JSON representation of its structured form by calling `parseJavaCode`.

### Parameters
- `fileContent`: A `String` representing the content of the Java file to be parsed and converted.

### Returns
- A JSON `String` representation of `JavaFileStructure`, or a JSON formatted error message in case of failure.

### Execution Flow
1. **Create ObjectMapper**: An instance of `ObjectMapper` is created to handle JSON serialization.
2. **Pretty Print Configuration**: The `ObjectMapper` is configured to pretty print the JSON output.
3. **Parsing**: It attempts to call `parseJavaCode(fileContent)` to obtain a `JavaFileStructure`.
4. **Null Check**: If the structure is `null` (indicating a parsing error), it returns a JSON string representing the error.
5. **Serialization**: If parsing is successful, it serializes the `JavaFileStructure` to JSON format and returns it.
6. **Exception Handling**: If there's an exception during parsing or serialization, it catches it, logs the error, and returns a JSON formatted error message.

### Business Logic
This function is crucial for converting the parsed Java code structure into a format that is easily consumable by other systems or applications. JSON is a widely used data interchange format, which means this function enables API usage, frontend integrations, or data storage in a standardized way.

## Function 3: `main(String[] args)`

### Overview
The `main` function is the entry point for executing the program. It contains a predefined Java code snippet that is passed to the `parseCodeToJSON` function.

### Parameters
- `args`: An array of `String` arguments from the command line (not used in this implementation).

### Execution Flow
1. **Sample Java Code Creation**: A multi-line `String` containing a Java code snippet (the implementation of a Rubik's Cube) is defined.
2. **JSON Conversion**: The method calls `SimpleJavaParser.parseCodeToJSON(javaCode)` to parse the sample code and convert it into JSON.
3. **Output**: The resulting JSON string is printed to the console.

### Business Logic
The `main` method serves as a demonstration of how to use the `SimpleJavaParser` class. By invoking `parseCodeToJSON`, it showcases the end-to-end flow of parsing and converting Java code to JSON format. This allows developers to understand how the parser operates with real Java code and provides a quick way to test its functionality.

---

## Conclusion
The `SimpleJavaParser` class is structured to effectively parse Java code into a manageable format and convert it into JSON. The flow begins with parsing in `parseJavaCode`, proceeds to JSON conversion in `parseCodeToJSON`, and culminates in the `main` function that initiates the process. Each function builds upon the previous one, demonstrating a well-defined separation of responsibilities and a clear execution path. This modularity enhances maintainability and allows for easy updates or extensions in the future.
