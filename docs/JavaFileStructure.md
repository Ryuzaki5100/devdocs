# Documentation for JavaFileStructure's toString() Function

## Overview
The `JavaFileStructure.toString()` function is designed to provide a comprehensive and formatted string representation of the structure of a Java file. This includes details about imports, classes, fields, methods, and any associated annotations. The function employs a `StringBuilder` to construct the output efficiently, ensuring clear readability for any consumers of the data. 

### Business Logic
The primary business logic behind the `toString()` function is to encapsulate the entire structure of a Java file in a human-readable format. This can be useful for debugging, logging, or displaying the structure of Java files in user interfaces. Each component of a Java file (imports, classes, fields, methods) is explored and enumerated, thereby providing a clear view of how the file is constructed.

### Function Flow
1. **Initialization**: 
   - A `StringBuilder` instance `sb` is created to efficiently compile the output string.

2. **Appending Imports**: 
   - The output starts with a header "Imports:\n", and for each import found in the `imports` collection, it appends the import statement to the `StringBuilder`. Each import is prefixed with spaces for indentation.

3. **Iterating Through Classes**:
   - For each `JavaClassStructure` object contained in the `classes` collection, the function performs the following steps:
     - Appends a new class header that includes the class name.
     - Checks if the class has any annotations and appends them if present.
     - Checks if the class extends another class and appends that information if available.
     - Checks if the class implements any interfaces and appends that information as well.

4. **Appending Fields**:
   - For each class, a section titled "Fields:" is created. Each field of type `JavaFieldStructure` is iterated over, and the method appends the field's type and name. If there are any annotations on the field, they are added in parentheses next to the field's description.

5. **Appending Methods**:
   - Similar to fields, a section titled "Methods:" is created. Each method of type `JavaMethodStructure` is reviewed, and its return type, name, parameters, and body (i.e. the method's implementation) are appended. Annotations associated with each method are also checked and included if present.

6. **Return Statement**:
   - Finally, the constructed string from the `StringBuilder` is returned, providing a complete overview of the Java file structure.

### Example of the Output Structure
The function's output will look something like this:

```
Imports:
  import java.util.List;
  import java.util.Map;

Class: MyClass
  Annotations: @Entity
  Extends: BaseClass
  Implements: Serializable
  Fields:
    - String name (Annotations: @NotNull)
    - int age
  Methods:
    - void myMethod(String param)
      Annotations: @Override
      Body: // method implementation here
```

### Conclusion
The `JavaFileStructure.toString()` function serves an essential role in helping developers and tools understand the composition of a Java file at a glance. By structuring the output methodically, it ensures that all significant aspects of the Java file structure are communicated effectively.
