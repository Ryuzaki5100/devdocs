# Documentation for `JavaFileStructure.toString()`

## Overview
The `toString()` function in the `JavaFileStructure` class is responsible for generating a human-readable string representation of a Java file structure. This formatted output includes information about the imports, classes, fields, methods, annotations, inherited classes, and implemented interfaces within the Java file. The function organizes this information in a structured and clear way to facilitate understanding and debugging.

## Flow of Execution
The `toString()` function executes in the following order:

1. **Initialization of StringBuilder**
   - A `StringBuilder` instance (`sb`) is created to efficiently build the string representation of the Java file structure.

   ```java
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
   ```

2. **Appending Imports**
   - The function begins by appending a header for the imports section to the StringBuilder.

   ```java
   sb.append("Imports:\n");
   ```
   - It then iterates over the `imports` list, appending each import statement to the StringBuilder, prefixed by spaces for formatting.
   
   ```java
   imports.forEach(i -> sb.append("  ").append(i).append("\n"));
   ```

3. **Iterating Through Classes**
   - The function proceeds to iterate over the `classes` list, which contains instances of `JavaClassStructure`. For each class, it carries out the following steps:

   ```java
   for (JavaClassStructure cls : classes) {
   ```

   - **Class Name Header**
     - Append the class name to the StringBuilder along with an appropriate header.

     ```java
     sb.append("\nClass: ").append(cls.name).append("\n");
     ```

   - **Annotating the Class**
     - If the class has annotations, they are appended to the StringBuilder under the annotations header.

     ```java
     if (!cls.annotations.isEmpty()) {
         sb.append("  Annotations: ").append(cls.annotations).append("\n");
     }
     ```

   - **Extended Class Information**
     - If the class extends another class, this information is appended as well.

     ```java
     if (!cls.extendedClass.isEmpty()) {
         sb.append("  Extends: ").append(cls.extendedClass).append("\n");
     }
     ```

   - **Implemented Interfaces**
     - If the class implements any interfaces, a list is generated and added to the output.

     ```java
     if (!cls.implementedInterfaces.isEmpty()) {
         sb.append("  Implements: ").append(cls.implementedInterfaces).append("\n");
     }
     ```

4. **Field Details**
   - The function provides a list of fields for each class, prefixed with a "Fields:" header.

   ```java
   sb.append("  Fields:\n");
   for (JavaFieldStructure field : cls.fields) {
       sb.append("    - ").append(field.type).append(" ").append(field.name);
   ```

   - If a field has annotations, those annotations are appended next to the field.

   ```java
   if (!field.annotations.isEmpty()) {
       sb.append(" (Annotations: ").append(field.annotations).append(")");
   }
   sb.append("\n");
   ```

5. **Method Details**
   - A section titled "Methods:" is created to list methods for the class.

   ```java
   sb.append("  Methods:\n");
   for (JavaMethodStructure method : cls.methods) {
       sb.append("    - ").append(method.returnType).append(" ").append(method.name)
          .append("(").append(String.join(", ", method.parameters)).append(")\n");
   ```

   - Similar to fields, if there are annotations on a method, they are also appended.

   ```java
   if (!method.annotations.isEmpty()) {
       sb.append("      Annotations: ").append(method.annotations).append("\n");
   }
   sb.append("      Body: ").append(method.body).append("\n");
   ```

6. **Returning the Result**
   - After all the information is appended to the StringBuilder, the complete string representation is returned.

   ```java
   return sb.toString();
   ```

## Business Logic
The `toString()` function is crucial for providing a comprehensive overview of the Java file structure, making it useful for developers who need to quickly get insights into the codebase. This function can be utilized in various contexts, such as logging, documentation generation, or during debugging to verify the architecture of the Java classes.

The function's careful structuring and organization of data ensure clarity. By categorizing information into representations of imports, classes, fields, and methods, it acts as both a summary and a detailed report of the Java file's content. This promotes better understanding and maintainability of the code, thereby enhancing productivity within software development workflows. 

## Conclusion
The `JavaFileStructure.toString()` method encapsulates the complexity of Java file structures in a digestible format. This string representation is particularly useful for code analysis tools, documentation generators, and IDE features that provide insights into the structure and organization of a Java project.
