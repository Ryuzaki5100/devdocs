# Cube Class Documentation

This document provides a developer-friendly overview of the `Cube` class, which represents a Rubik's Cube in a 3x3x3 configuration. It's designed for developers who are unfamiliar with the codebase.

## Overview

The `Cube` class models a Rubik's Cube and provides functionality for manipulating and representing its state. It manages the positions and orientations of edges and corners, and includes methods for executing moves, cloning, and converting between different representations.

## Key Concepts

* **Edges and Corners:** The cube is represented by its edges and corners, each having a position and orientation.
* **Moves:** The cube can be manipulated by executing standard Rubik's Cube moves (R, U, F, B, L, D).
* **Positions and Orientations:** The `EdgePos`, `EdgeOrientation`, `CornerPos`, and `CornerOrientation` classes (not shown in this code snippet, but assumed to exist) store the positions and orientations of the cube's components.
* **Binary Encoding:** The `binEncoding` map is used to represent faces of the cube with binary values, facilitating efficient calculations.
* **Priority:** The `priority` map assigns a priority to each face, used to determine reference points during cube initialization.

## Class Structure

### Fields

* **`nextEdgePos` (Map<Character, EdgePos>):** Maps each move (R, U, F, B, L, D) to the resulting edge positions.
* **`nextCornerPos` (Map<Character, CornerPos>):** Maps each move to the resulting corner positions.
* **`nextEdgeOrientation` (Map<Character, List<Map<Byte, Byte>>>):** Maps each move to a list of maps, which detail the changes in edge orientation.
* **`nextCornerOrientation` (Map<Character, List<Map<Byte, Byte>>>):** Maps each move to a list of maps, which detail the changes in corner orientation.
* **`edgeList` (byte[][]):** Defines the pairs of facelet indices that make up each edge.
* **`cornerList` (byte[][]):** Defines the triplets of facelet indices that make up each corner.
* **`binEncoding` (Map<Character, Byte>):** Maps each face (U, L, F, R, B, D) to its binary encoding.
* **`priority` (Map<Character, Byte>):** Maps each face to its priority value.
* **`edgeNumberForPos` (Map<Byte, Byte>):** Maps binary edge positions to edge numbers.
* **`cornerNumberForPos` (Map<Byte, Byte>):** Maps binary corner positions to corner numbers.
* **`edgePossiblePlacesStage3` (int[][]):** Defines the possible places for each edge in stage 3.
* **`cornerPossiblePlacesStage3` (int[][]):** Defines the possible places for each corner in stage 3.
* **`edge` (Edge):** Represents the edge state of the cube.
* **`corner` (Corner):** Represents the corner state of the cube.

### Constructors

* **`Cube()`:** Creates a new solved cube.
* **`Cube(Cube c)`:** Creates a copy of an existing cube.
* **`Cube(Edge edge, Corner corner)`:** Creates a cube with specified edge and corner states.
* **`Cube(String colorInput)`:** Initializes a cube from a string representation of its colors.

### Methods

* **`clone()`:** Creates and returns a deep copy of the cube.
* **`execute(Cube c, String s)`:** Executes a sequence of moves on a cube and returns the resulting cube.
* **`reverseAlgorithm(String s)`:** Reverses a move sequence.
* **`getAlgorithm(String moves)`:** Converts a move sequence string into a list of individual moves.
* **`toString()`:** Returns a string representation of the cube's state.
* **`getEdge()`:** Returns the edge state of the cube.
* **`setEdge(Edge edge)`:** Sets the edge state of the cube.
* **`getCorner()`:** Returns the corner state of the cube.
* **`setCorner(Corner corner)`:** Sets the corner state of the cube.

### Static Initialization

* The static initializer block initializes `edgeNumberForPos` and `cornerNumberForPos` maps, which map binary representations of edge and corner positions to their respective indices.

## Usage Examples

```java
Cube cube = new Cube(); // Create a solved cube
Cube movedCube = Cube.execute(cube, "R U R' U'"); // Execute a move sequence
String reversedMoves = Cube.reverseAlgorithm("R U R' U'"); // Reverse a move sequence
ArrayList<String> movesList = Cube.getAlgorithm("RUR'U'"); // Returns List of moves
Cube initializedCube = new Cube("your_color_input_string"); // Create cube from color input
